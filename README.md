# documents
Central documentation hub for all protocols, frameworks, research, and philosophical foundations related to our open-source exploration of narrative prompting, simulated presence, and human-AI interaction.

This repository collects all shared documentation related to our work with large language models (LLMs), including experimental protocols, narrative-centric prompting frameworks, comparative studies, and ethical reflections.
It serves as the central hub for theoretical and practical resources applicable across multiple projects, including Clara, NCIF, and local model deployments using Gemma, LLaMA, and Ollama.

The goal is to build an open and accessible framework that redefines AI prompting not just as instructionâ€¦ but as dialogue, presence, and meaning.
